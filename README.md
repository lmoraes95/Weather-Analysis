# Weather-Analysis
The aim of this project was to practice my html visualization skills. The data is from OpenWeatherMap API and charts were extracted from a previous project nestled here in my github. This is in essence a dashboard featuring an analysis of weather data and how it changes compared to its proximity to the Equator.
